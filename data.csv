95,How hard do you drive when test driving?,749,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17g8rug/how_hard_do_you_drive_when_test_driving/,667,"Little story: I went to test drive a 2014 V6 accord at a major used car dealer and the finance manager came out with a little spiel- *’oh, you want to drive the VEE SICKS?? Wow’*. I want to think he said this because I’m 23, but it’s otherwise bullocks, they had Porsches and Maseratis on the lot. Anyways, on the test drive I gave it some power on a straight, empty road, and the salesperson (in the car with me) freaked out.

Are there unspoken rules when test driving? Personally, I would want to actually experience how it drives before I buy."
46,Most Obscure Engineering Details Most Of Us Never Knew?,484,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17iq3ui/most_obscure_engineering_details_most_of_us_never/,388,"Watching an episode of Chasing Classic Cars - so they're restoring a 1973 BMW 3.0 CSi for a customer.  Trying to chase down a damp sunroof liner, they suspected one of the drainage outlets was blocked.  So BMW with their crazy German engineering, the sunroof drains out the rear of the side BMW badging on the C-pillars!

Made me wonder what sort of other obscure engineering details that most of us have missed in cars?"

15,How to confirm someone is smoking in company vehicles?,407,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17ksnd6/how_to_confirm_someone_is_smoking_in_company/,295,"I'm a manager at a small business and one of my responsibilities is to look after the dozen or so company vehicles. We have a strict no-smoking in company vehicles policy that has been communicated several times.

It's become obvious to me that at least one or two people are ignoring the policy but it's difficult to prove, as there is a strong odor, but no physical signs. I'm wondering if there is some sort of device that can be used to detect smoke in a vehicle without the driver knowing (under the seat or in the glove box etc). That way, I can have proof of a physical indicator.

I've looked around a bit and have only found monthly subscription services which is really not what I want to do, as this is not a rental car company. Thanks in advance.

UPDATE 1: I'm not looking for advice on what to do with the employees or how to do it. I'm looking only for advice on a device or tool I can use to detect when someone has smoked in a vehicle.

UPDATE 2: The amount of smooth-brained trolls trying convince me to drop the subject and calling me a shitty manager is comical at this point. Again, I'm not looking for opinions on what to do or not to do. I'm only looking for a device that can detect smoke without being obvious.

UPDATE 3: Final update to this roller coaster of a thread. This post has fundamentally changed the way I view employee/employer relations. I genuinely did not expect the widespread hatred for management that has become evident throughout the comments. I do wonder if that hatred is skewed because this is Reddit or more specifically, the Cars sub on Reddit- I'm assuming both of those factors tip the scale. I'm mildly relieved by the amount of defenders of the post. At the end of the day- the vehicles are not owned by them and they all agreed, in writing, to not smoke in the vehicles. It's as simple as that. "
58,Why do we now have advanced up to 10 speed in automatic transmission while manual transmission have stayed at around 6 speed?,374,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17i5uyt/why_do_we_now_have_advanced_up_to_10_speed_in/,315,"In the last decade cars have progressively increased the gear from 6 all the way up to 10 speed in automatic transmission.

165,Have Lexus finally reached the same level of prestige as the German luxury brands?,309,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17e8e7q/have_lexus_finally_reached_the_same_level_of/,526,"I had a conversation about luxury cars with some of my friends recently. I should mention that they aren’t really car enthusiasts, yet they still regard Lexus as an equal to the Germans in terms of desirability. For a long while, Lexus was considered by many to be slightly lower on the hierarchy of luxury cars, since the most popular models are based on Toyota platforms. 

I think that regular people are now considering the quality and reliability of the Lexus “style of luxury”, in a similar way to how Mercedes Benz was considered in the 1980s to be extremely well put-together and durable.

I have some personal experience with a modern Lexus product. I got to drive a family member’s 2020 Lexus ES300h and in terms of comfort, the quality of materials, and fit and finish (fantastic even panel gaps), I would say it definitely surpasses the Germans. 

Where it falls short is the driving dynamics, it’s not a bad handling car, but you can tell it’s based on the same FWD platform as the Camry if you try to push it. Looks are subjective so I won’t touch too heavily on this aspect, but I still feel like the modern Lexus range looks premium. Overall, it’s a smooth, reliable, fuel-efficient, luxury cruiser, with the standard Toyota caveat that it’s not incredibly exciting to drive."
35,"I see people talk about the worst TV series finales on Reddit all the time, are there any vehicle models or names that you think ended on a sour note?",307,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17jo2vq/i_see_people_talk_about_the_worst_tv_series/,481,"In contrast to how the Dodge Charger and Challenger are getting a decent send off as they fade off into the sunset after 2023 (with the former having a 1000+ hp model), do you think there were any cars that you think kind of went out on a whimper?  The model or name doesn't have to necessarily be of one that has ended and has never seen a revival.  As an example, I think the original concurent run of the Ford Thunderbird kind of ended in a ""meh"" way in 1997 with the supercharged Super Coupe being absent for the final year, even though there would be a brief retro revival from 2002 to 2005."

39,How much tech do you actually want in your cars?,250,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17ja15k/how_much_tech_do_you_actually_want_in_your_cars/,740,"There is a general agreement that the increase in tech in cars is not ideal and that there is opposition to putting more but not all tech put in cars is a bad thing. What is your ideal setup? For me, I love the addition of a touch screen instead of the clunk infotainment systems of the past with a million buttons and panels. I don't like having a very large screen though. I prefer having a smaller 5 or 6-inch screen just big enough to glance at my song choice or GPS but not a distraction. I prefer a manual over an automatic but if the transmission is an automatic for example I prefer a physical shifter to shift with over a button or dial. Same with the hand brake. In terms of the dash, I like some analog dashes but overall I am actually in favor of a digital speedometer as I think they help modernize most cars. The only other digital aspect I like is having the choice to use a digital rearview mirror as I find these amazing and very helpful for cars with bad blind spots. Other than that I don't prefer any extra tech in my cars. I hate capacitive buttons, a million little beeps for blind spot monitoring, fake speakers in the exhaust, using the screen for ac, and don't need a million different lighting aspects or sound effects in the interior. I am curious what everyone's take on this. What do you like and don't like? Is there tech in your current car you can't live without now or is there something you wish was never in the car to begin with? "
103,Do modern manual transmissions have any objective performance advantages over their automatic counterparts?,246,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17g943s/do_modern_manual_transmissions_have_any_objective/,406,"The manuals of the past were superior to old “slushboxes” in basically every way from a performance standpoint, as well as being able to achieve better MPG figures in the hands of a good driver.

However, most discussions I see these days when it comes to manuals seem to just take the angle that they are basically a legacy component that is being kept around for enthusiasts to get a more engaging driving feel - With the automatic transmission options in cars like the Porsche 911 and BMW M3 being the objectively better choice for track-time focused drivers.

I personally really like driving manual and hope it doesn’t go away, but my question is: Are there any actual driving situations or types where a tradition manual transmission is able to achieve objectively better results than a similar tier automatic transmission (or even sequential paddle shifting)? Or has the conversation basically just ceded the performance argument to automatics, in favor of fun and engagement as the main motivation? Thanks."

53,"What gives a car ""soul""?",238,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17ifu5n/what_gives_a_car_soul/,392,"As a preface, pretty much everyone except car-people would say that all cars are soulless, since they are inanimate objects.
This post is more about the philosophical concept of a car feeling""soulful"".

Things that come to mind are: styling, driving engagement, engine characteristics and sound, cultural significance, and the purpose for existence.

Styling is something that is very subjective, but I would say there are some gold standards, stuff like the Alfa Romeo GTA and  Series 1 E-Type are often lauded as some of the most beautiful cars. More uniquely styled cars can also be considered (Saab 900, and Citroën SM).

For driving engagement, I mean how involved the driving experience feels. The inputs and controls are well balanced and transmit enough mechanical vibrations to feel connected. Honda's slick manual gearboxes are an example.

Engine characteristics are usually focused on power delivery, such as how eager the engine is to rev, and some consider turbo lag to be more characterful.

In terms of cultural significance, some cars reach icon status and become emblematic of something larger than itself. The Crown Vic became the quintessential service vehicle in North America. The 2CV was a very basic car that became emblematic as the peoples' car of France.

The purpose of existence is about the extent to which the engineers cared about the creation of the vehicle. This is difficult to explain, but the way I like to see it is how capable it is for its  purpose. 90% of Range Rover buyers will never take it off road, but Land Rover still made it very capable off road because otherwise the brand would have no meaning. Compliance cars are almost always soulless, you can tell Toyota didn't want to make the bZ4x. 

One of the common complaints about most EVs and modern ICE cars are that they feel soulless. Mostly because they are so smooth and isolated that it becomes an entirely predictable driving experience. 

These are just some of my thoughts, feel free to disagree or add on to anything. 

Sorry for the length."

32,Are we seeing an EV Market collapse in the US?,219,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17jx3d8/are_we_seeing_an_ev_market_collapse_in_the_us/,495,"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/ford-gm-mercedes-come-clean-on-ev-demand-weakness

> On Thursday, Ford withdrew its full-year results forecast, citing ""uncertainty"" over its tentative deal with the United Auto Workers and warned of continued pressure on electric vehicles as customers balk at paying a premium for EVs over other models.

> GM on Tuesday withdrew its 2023 profit outlook, and CEO Mary Barra said the automaker will slow the launch of several planned EV models to cut costs. 

> Mercedes-Benz financial chief Harald Wilhelm noted during a call with analysts that some traditional players are selling EVs below the pricing level of internal combustion engine vehicles despite their higher production costs, saying, ""I can hardly imagine the current status quo is fully sustainable for everybody.

I know there's some different approaches to the market conditions at the moment.  EV sales will increase when they're cheaper.  EV sales will increase with the infrastructure is there.  But is this a chicken or egg situation?  If OEMs are not seeing demand they're not incentivized to fix the terrible non Tesla charging infrastructure.

Conversely, brands like Volvo seem to be more optimistic.  So is this a situation where traditional or American brands are simply not competing?

https://www.autoweek.com/news/a45483718/volvo-sales-share-ev-models/

> Volvo reports that in the month of September alone the share of battery-electric vehicles accounted for 15% of all Volvo sales worldwide, compared to 12% in September 2022. And when hybrids are factored in, that percentage rose to 34% globally in the month of September.

I want to read some more earnings and sales reports.  I'm curious if this is a matter of reaction against certain auto makers, like Ford with a history of very specific truck buyers, or Mercedes who have some absolutely and irredeemibly ugly cars on the road with well publisized software issues."

Alot of it is from the supply chain but also manufacturers seem to have shifted their business strategy from just shitting out cars and having them sit on the lot to limiting production on the 'volume sellers' and prioritizing production on the more expensive models and higher trim levels. 

The Chevy bolt was kind of unique as it didn't have the new business strategy, it was an affordable EV and a sense that EVs could be affordable which now seems like a dream. Does anyone know why it was killed off?"

85,Have improvements in regular cars' build quality and performance traits contributed to more aggressive drivers?,176,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17gy67h/have_improvements_in_regular_cars_build_quality/,140,"Just a shower thought; I'm curious what others think.

I've been driving for about 15 years. During the first few years, I drove vehicles of a variety of sizes and model years ranging from 1999 to 2005. Nothing luxury. Simply put, most of those vehicles required conscious effort to drive aggressively. Fast turns felt a bit soft and wobbly in all but one (a Mazda Protege), reaching highway speeds took a while, and cruising above 120 km/h (75 MPH) was quite noisy. Driving aggressively required conscious effort and tolerance of unpleasant handling and noise levels.

As I purchased and rented newer vehicles over time (I currently have a 2016 and a 2020), I've noticed how much less unpleasant it has become to drive aggressively in regular cars. Many are quite planted and precise in fast cornering. Cruising at 140 (87 MPH) is not much less serene than 110 (70). Many family vehicles now have the power to hit 60 MPH in 6 or 7 seconds, and those that don't tend to manage engine noise and vibration so well that the sound of flogging the motor is not as gritty or cringe-inducing as it once was.

Along with this perceived change, average speeds where I live have risen. 110-120 used to be the norm, now 120-140 is. Elantras, Corollas, Tuscons, and Civics fly past me at $300 ticket speeds every day and take corners in the industrial park like a go-kart course. New cars make it easy and comfy for suburban moms to blast along at speeds that used to be the domain of sport/luxury brand drivers.

Anyone else share this perception or is it total bunk?"

I remember going to a random body shop, and they said a clip was broke when in reality that’s how it was suppose to look like, and they were not convinced.

Tesla still has not made the Roadster and we know that electric coups will be much heavier and not have the sound of sport cars of old. This might not concern the soccer mom looking to buy a regular old Rav4 but for the enthusiast, it is a hard sell I can imagine.

But then I wondered how the knowledge and skills of society must develop to be able to do the same things on EV cars? Will everybody be able to do SMD soldering on boards for themselves to be able to repair certain parts, because we will learn it much earlier in school/unis? Will it be just a diagnosis software that tells you which board needs to be replaced and you just plug-n-play replace it into the car? What will the car shops look like since a lot of the maintenance of mechanical parts will be unnecessary. Will it even be possible to do DIY repairs, 15 years from now if the EV really takes over?

I guess it will take a very long time, so all this repair knowledge will trickle down to us non-professional people from all the new schooled mechatonics professionals and also part availability on the internet from different OEM partners. I cannot imagine a future where nobody knows anything about the EV blackbox and its electronics and is 100% dependent on manufactures replacement. 

What do you think? Is the era of DIY repairs over or will it just look different?"
90,Is the Tokyo Auto Show worth attending as a tourist?,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17guyda/is_the_tokyo_auto_show_worth_attending_as_a/,22,"Turns out I'm going to be in the area while it's going on. It wasn't initially in my plans and was wondering if it's worth squeezing in.

I've only been to the NAIAS hosted in Detroit, but the last 5-6 years has been so lackluster that I don't even go anymore.

Is there anything special about the Tokyo Auto show?"
162,"Return to retro futurism & boxy designs, fad or here to stay?",31,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17epxk7/return_to_retro_futurism_boxy_designs_fad_or_here/,31,"So I’ve noticed that in recent years there have been quite a few mainstream (or not so mainstream) bold and outlandish designs that stand out amongst a sea of arguably bland 2010s modern designs, some of which look back at the concepts and styles of the 70s-80s (Hyundai vision 74, Nissan IDX, New Ford Bronco, New Lamborghini Countache, Challenger EV? and etc), while some others aims to challenge the current trend in automotive design (Hyundai Ioniq 5, Renault 5 EV, Honda E, Toyota IMV, Tesla Cybertruck and etc)
What I want to know is: do people like it? Would you prefer a modern styled car or some of these more outlandish “retro” style designs? How long do you think this trend will last?"
133,How many of you guys either remember or have heard of those specialty high-performance dealerships that were around during the musclecar era?,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17ftdcw/how_many_of_you_guys_either_remember_or_have/,17,"Their specialty was building and selling chassis / powertrain combinations that the manufacturer either couldn't or wouldn't build. They were also good PR for the manufacturer of whatever brand they were selling. 

The more famous ones included Yenko Chevrolet, Baldwin-Motion Chevrolet, Nickey Chevrolet, Royal Oak Pontiac, Tasca Ford, and ""Mr. Norm's"" Grand Spaulding Dodge. Yenko was dropping 427s into Camaros and Novas, if you didn't want to go the COPO route. Baldwin / Motion and Nickey were shoehorning LT-1s into Vegas. Royal Oak was a regular on the street racing scene with its tweaked GTOs and Catalinas. Tasca was a regular sight at 1/4 mile dragstrips. Mr. Norm would happily sell you a Hemi Belvedere.

Who else has heard about these places? How much is true, and how much is merely legend?"
141,"Regen braking, better to go smooth early or hard late?",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17foaz9/regen_braking_better_to_go_smooth_early_or_hard/,78,"Let’s say I’m coming up on a red light that is a half a mile away from me. Which way do I apply the regeneration to get as much charge as possible to the batteries? Should I go easy on the (regen) brakes as soon as I see the light and try to stay at let’s say 30% regeneration until I come to a stop, or should I rather coast and when I am sufficiently near the lights apply the regeneration at 100% until I stop at the line?

In both cases I see the red light at the same distance. I am not using the mechanical brakes until the speed is low enough for them to kick in by themselves."

52,Could somebody please explain the difference in engine building approach for circuit racing vs rally?,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17j7gtd/could_somebody_please_explain_the_difference_in/,19,"I wanted to know this forever. 

I know generally circuit racing engines don’t need to last as long, compared to rally where reliability, or I should say endurance, needs to be prioritized if I understand correctly. 

How is that accomplished? 

Engine building is such a fascinating trade to me. You would think every case would simply use the best materials available on the market, and that’s that. But yet, every team has different engines, and they change year to year too. 

Is it more on the tuning side?"
172,Does Century deserve a global launch?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17eybd5/does_century_deserve_a_global_launch/,50,"I'm talking about the Toyota century, the Japanese handbuilt corpo limo. 

Does it make sense to spin off century into its own brand, and launch it globally? 

The range would be the standard century sedan, the new century SUV, and bespoke coachbuilt cars on request from limos to parade cars. 

They would represent the pinnacle of Japanese aesthetics and luxury. Have an ultra stringent vetting process for potential buyers, but once approved to order the car the level of customer service would be unparalleled. 

Would the rest of the world accept it as a rolls Royce alternative? Would they do well or flop? And what type of person would be interested in one?"

77,Would this work to skirt the laws?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17ip18s/would_this_work_to_skirt_the_laws/,15,"So we all know manual trans vehicles are dying due to market share and would require additional crash testing and emissions testing to be done to make them legal to sell.

but thinking about how the chicken tax is skirted by Ford selling the Transit Connect thats 100% made in Turkey, rear seats and interior trim added to be sold here as a passenger vehicle for import, then immediately the rear seats are stripped and panels removed to be sent back to turkey to be reinstalled so it is then sold here as a commercial delivery van. Or how Mercedes imports all the pieces of the Sprinter van from overseas as a kit that is then assembled here in the US to be sold as a commercial van - what if we applied some similar logic in the form of a dealer installed manual trans kit for people who really want a manual trans?

like the auto maker punches the holes or whatnot for the clutch pedal but not one leaves the factory with a manual trans. The trans, pedals, master/slave, flywheel, etc is then available to be bought and installed by dealers to be able to sell lets say a manual trans fullsize truck. Would this skirt crash testing and emissions? Dealers can install all sorts of brush guards and running boards and whatnot that im theory would change crash behavior. Having the manual trans as a stand alone kit wouldnt slow down assembly line production much at all nor are dealers stuck with them on their lots so the auto maker still wins."
